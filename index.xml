      <description>Who I am a software developer from Salzburg/Austria and currently working in Bavaria as a C++ software engineer for BSH Homeappliances.
Hobbies I enjoy travelling around the world, going for a mountain bike ride or for a nice hike in the mountains of this area. Further, I also enjoy programming in my spare time. Usually I come up with a project idea and then try to solve it with various technologies.</description>

      <description>Following some projects I have been working on in my spare time.
 Python Picture-to-Text Weatherstation Coffee Grinder Automation Mara-X-Meter  Python Picture-to-Text I enjoy the thrive to the paperless world, as I find it much easier to organize documents digitally. But since many documents are still required as a hardcopy, one is forced to archive those. A tough question then is: How many and which categories of organizers will one need for all documents?</description>
