      <description>Who I am a software developer from Salzburg/Austria and currently working in Bavaria as a C++ software engineer for BSH Homeappliances.
Hobbies I enjoy travelling around the world, going for a mountain bike ride or for a nice hike in the mountains of this area. Further, I also enjoy programming in my spare time. Usually I come up with a project idea and then try to solve it with various technologies.</description>
