# About

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Anton A. Jerey, a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in developing innovative solutions and exploring new technologies.

## Professional Background

I am a senior software engineer with extensive experience in C++. Over the years, I have worked on various projects that have honed my skills in software development and engineering principles.

Apart from several internships, I have been working at BSH GmbH since November 2015. Initially starting as an external employee, the company hired me at the beginning of 2016. Since then, I have worked on three major projects:

- Currently, I am the technical lead of an in-house C++ framework for application development used by five product divisions across three countries.
- Designed, implemented, and maintained a coffee maker middleware software used by all upcoming coffee machines with a touch display.
- Designed, implemented, and maintained an oven middleware software used by multiple ovens.

Additionally, I enjoy being a mentor for new colleagues and organizing knowledge transfers and group code reviews.

## Interests

- **Programming:** I enjoy coding and continuously expanding my knowledge in C++, as well as exploring new programming languages and frameworks.
- **Technology:** I am fascinated by how technology can enhance our lives and the endless possibilities it offers for improvement.
- **Traveling:** Exploring the world - both near and far - is a great way to gather new perspectives and experiences.
- **Photography:** Traveling to the north of Sweden allowed me to witness the northern lights, sparking my passion for photography and the joy of capturing great photos.
- **Biking:** I enjoy biking, whether it's a solo ride or with friends, as it offers both relaxation and adventure.
